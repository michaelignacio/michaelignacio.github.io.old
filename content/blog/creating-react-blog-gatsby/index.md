I was trying to find the best solution for a blog, and I thought I'd create mine in Gatsby. And hey - obligatory <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program" target="_blank">Hello World</a>!

### You could have just whipped up a Wordpress blog

A few years ago the answer might have been a Wordpress blog (and for a lot of use cases, I'm pretty sure it still is). When Node.js came out, the answer might have been Ghost. And I'm sure there are plenty other options - even Medium (for some reason I keep getting error 500 on Medium, so that's off my list).

React is everywhere these days, so it's good to create a blog in GatsbyJS, a "blazing fast" site generator for React.

The speed is pretty evident once you've tried navigating on a website written in Gatsby (like this blog).

### Requirements

I used <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog" target="_blank">this starter template</a> because there's no point reinventing the wheel.

The installation process is simple - just make sure you have `node`, `npm`, and `gatsby` installed - then you can clone the starter template above (you'll need to have `git` installed for this).

### Conclusion

I'm pretty impressed with the end product - it really shows how having a static site really gives you a blazing fast website.

I'll be filling this blog with entries detailing my development process, so stay tuned!
