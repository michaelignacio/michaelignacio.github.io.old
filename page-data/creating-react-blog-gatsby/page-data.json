And hey - obligatory <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program\" target=\"_blank\">Hello World</a>!</p>\n<h3>You could have just whipped up a Wordpress blog</h3>\n<p>A few years ago the answer might have been a Wordpress blog (and for a lot of use cases, I’m pretty sure it still is). When Node.js came out, the answer might have been Ghost. And I’m sure there are plenty other options - even Medium (for some reason I keep getting error 500 on Medium, so that’s off my list).</p>\n<p>React is everywhere these days, so it’s good to create a blog in GatsbyJS, a “blazing fast” site generator for React.</p>\n<p>The speed is pretty evident once you’ve tried navigating on a website written in Gatsby (like this blog).</p>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<p>I used <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog\" target=\"_blank\">this starter template</a> because there’s no point reinventing the wheel.</p>\n<p>The installation process is simple - just make sure you have <code class=\"language-text\">node</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">npm</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby</code> installed - then you can clone the starter template above (you’ll need to have <code class=\"language-text\">git</code> installed for this).</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>I’m pretty impressed with the end product - it really shows how having a static site really gives you a blazing fast website.</p>\n<p>I’ll be filling this blog with entries detailing my development process, so stay tuned!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Creating a blog with Gatsby","date":"July 01, 2019","description":"I was trying to find the best solution for a blog, and I thought I'd create mine in Gatsby.
